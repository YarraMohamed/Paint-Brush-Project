Paint Brush Application ðŸŽ¨

This repository showcases my first project during the Java course at ITI: a simple Paint Brush application developed using Java. The project emphasizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and Java's event handling mechanism.

âœ¨ Key Features:

Drawing lines, rectangles, and ovals

Free pencil tool

Eraser tool

Undo button

Clear button

Four color options: Black, Blue, Red, Green

ðŸŽ¯ Project Highlights:

The Paint Brush application was designed to strengthen my understanding of event handling and graphics in Java. Key concepts applied in this project include:

Event Handling: Responding dynamically to user interactions like mouse clicks and movements.

Object-Oriented Programming: Implementing inheritance for clean and reusable code.
