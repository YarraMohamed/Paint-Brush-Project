Paint Brush Application ðŸŽ¨

This repository showcases my first project during the Java course at ITI: a simple Paint Brush application developed using Java. The project emphasizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and Java's event handling mechanism.

âœ¨ Key Features:

1- Drawing lines, rectangles, and ovals

2- Free pencil tool

3- Eraser tool

4- Undo button

5- Clear button

6- Four color options: Black, Blue, Red, Green

ðŸŽ¯ Project Highlights:

The Paint Brush application was designed to strengthen my understanding of event handling and graphics in Java. Key concepts applied in this project include:

1- Event Handling: Responding dynamically to user interactions like mouse clicks and movements.

2- Object-Oriented Programming: Implementing inheritance for clean and reusable code.

ðŸ“‚ Technologies Used:

Java
